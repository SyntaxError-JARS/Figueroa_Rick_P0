User Stories

As a user, I can:

 register a new user account with the system (must be secured with a password)
 login with my existing credentials
 create at least one account
 deposit funds into an account (use doubles, not ints)
 withdraw funds from an account (no overdrafting!)
 view the balance of my account(s) (all balance displays must be in proper currency format)
